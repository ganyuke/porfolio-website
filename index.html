        <p style="font-size:120%;">Signal is a <strong>free and open-source</strong> end-to-end encrypted instant messaging service available on Android, iOS, and PC and used by journalists and world leaders across the globe, funded <em>not</em> by ads, but by donations to the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Signal Foundation.
        <hr>    
        <h2>Here's why:</h2>
        <p>Signal prides itself on being a <i>private</i> competitor to Whatsapp; one of its founders even being Whatsapp's former co-founder.</p>
        <p>The Signal Protocol has been independently audited by security researchers across the world, passing with flying colors. The app has also been endorsed by the famed (or perhaps notorious) <abbr title="National Security Agency">NSA</abbr> whistleblower himself: <mark>Edward Snowden</mark>.</p>
        
        <blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/661313394906161152">"I use Signal every day."<br>- Edward Snowden</blockquote>
        
        <p>In 2016, Open Whisper Systems (OWS), the predecessor to the Signal Foundation, was served a subpoena by a federal grand jury. However, all OWS could produce was the <q>account's creation time and the last time it was online</q>.</p>
        <p>As of January 2021, Signal has been downloaded over 105 million times, boasting 40 million concurrent users.</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://signal.org/download">Download</a> Signal today!</b><br><small>or <ins>else</ins>...!</small></p>
